# WHODAS 2.0 functionality prediction from digital biomarkers

Functional limitations are associated with poor clinical outcomes, higher mortality, and disability rates, especially in the elderly. Continuous assessment of patientsâ€™ functionality is important for clinical practice; however, traditional questionnaire-based assessment methods are very time-consuming and infrequently used. Mobile sensing offers a great range of sources that can assess function and disability daily.

This repository contains the baseline and follow-up approaches for predicting patient functionality using passively sensed digital biomarkers and socio-demographic information of psychiatric outpatients. 

## Baseline approach
This work aimed to prove the feasibility of an interpretable machine learning pipeline for predicting WHODAS 2.0 outcomes utilising solely passively collected digital biomarkers.
One-month long time-series data were summarised using statistical measures (minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard deviation, IQR), creating 64 features. A sequential feature selection method was then applied on each WHODAS 2.0 domain (cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, participation). Finally, the WHODAS 2.0 functional domain scores were predicted using linear regression on the best feature subsets.

## DL-based approach
In our second approach, we defined a pipeline that performs feature encoding for the daily information by applying Time2Vec, followed by an LSTM encoder with attention for the 48-long half-hourly daily sequences, then another LSTM encoder with attention for the 30-day embedded input sequence. A feed-forward layer on top of the second LSTM's outputs concatenated with socio-demographic data is then used to get the predictions. Moreover, since the temporal data is regularly sampled but frequently missing, probabilistic generative models are used to perform data imputation.
